# Overview

This is a personal portfolio website that I built using React. As someone who wants to go into Web Development, I felt it was important to get my feet wet with React. There seems to be an industry wide need for React developers, so I figured it couldn't hurt to look into it. This software displays a greeting, portfolio, and contact sections of a website, and is also fully responsive. There is the use of useState, and content is dynamic.

I learned a ton while building this website. Mostly that I have barely scratch the surface of React and all that it can do. It is a really impressive tool to have in my kit, and I am excited to be working on it more in the future.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and React for this project. React is able to host its own development server, so that is how I was able to see my changes reflected in real time. I also used SCSS for the styling of this site.

# Future Work

* Dynamically add images into my portfolio page. I was having issues with webpack, so the images there are just random images hosted on unsplash.
* Linking live demos of my projects into the portfolio page
* Adding a skills section, as well as a download resume section to the page
* Ultimately publishing and hosting the site so that it is live on the internet!
